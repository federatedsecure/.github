# about this project

**Federated Secure Computing** enables multiple data owners to collaborate without sharing their proprietary data.

- Federated: connects their different servers on-premises and in the cloud
- Secure: encrypts all communication in their private peer-to-peer network
- Computing: acts as a middleware to let them run joint analysis on their data

The motivation, architecture, design, and implementation choices are explained in the [technical whitepaper](https://github.com/federatedsecure/whitepaper).
