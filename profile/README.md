# about this project

**Federated Secure Computing** enables multiple data owners to collaborate without sharing their proprietary data.

- Federated: connects their different servers on-premises and in the cloud
- Secure: encrypts all communication in their private peer-to-peer network
- Computing: acts as a middleware to let them run joint analysis on their data

The motivation, architecture, design, and implementation choices are explained in the [technical whitepaper](https://github.com/federatedsecure/whitepaper).

For non-technical background information, see the project's landing page at [www.federatedsecure.com](https://www.federatedsecure.com).

Support is available at [federatedsecurecomputing@lrz.uni-muenchen.de](mailto:federatedsecurecomputing@lrz.uni-muenchen.de).

The project is hosted by [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html) and funded by [Stifterverband](https://www.stifterverband.org/english).
